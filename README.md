# omacosy

omakase + macOS + cosy. An [omarchy](https://omarchy.org)-style setup
for macOS: tiling window management with a real Super key and
Hyprland's dwindle layout, a status bar built for it (bar, popups,
sliders and screen dimming in one process), focus follows mouse,
trackpad workspace swipes, a Mission-Control-style workspace overview
with live previews, focused-window border rings, and one theme switch
that covers everything down to the wallpaper. All of it installs from
this one repo.

![The omacosy desktop — themed bar over the osaka-jade wallpaper](docs/screenshots/desktop.jpg)

The whole environment idles at about **157MB** of memory. Numbers per
process in [Memory use](#memory-use).

Most of it is seven small signed binaries (Swift and C) built by the installer,
because several of the existing tools are broken on macOS 26. The
details are under [What's inside](#whats-inside).

> Built for macOS 26 (Tahoe) on one desk: a MacBook Pro plus one
> external display. It tries to generalize (display roles instead of
> hardware names, per-display notch detection), but so far it has only
> run on this machine. The permission setup is real work. Issues and
> PRs welcome; support promises are not made.

## Fresh Mac

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paulsp94/omacosy.git ~/.local/share/omacosy &&
cd ~/.local/share/omacosy && ./install.sh
```

The clone location matters. Configs are symlinked into the repo, and
macOS privacy (TCC) blocks launchd services from reading `~/Documents`,
`~/Desktop` and `~/Downloads`. If you clone there anyway, the installer
falls back to copying configs; that still works, but edits then need an
`install.sh` re-run to apply.

The installer is idempotent. It installs Homebrew if missing, runs
`brew bundle`, compiles the helper binaries, generates the AeroSpace
config from your app choices, symlinks configs (backing up anything it
would replace), hides the native menu bar, applies the default theme,
and starts the services.

See [Permissions](#permissions) for the grants it asks of you, what
each one is used for, and what breaks without it. Karabiner-Elements
also asks you to approve its driver extension.

## Updating

```sh
omacosy-update          # pull, then re-run the installer
omacosy-update --check  # just say whether there is anything new
```

`install.sh` rebuilds only the binaries whose sources changed and
restarts their agents, so an update is a pull plus a re-run, and this
command wraps both. It refuses a clone with local edits, and refuses
one whose branch has diverged, rather than deciding either for you.

There is no background update check. The bar makes exactly one network
call (the weather), and a daemon polling GitHub on a timer would
quietly make that two. Nothing here contacts the network unless you
run it.

## Permissions

A window manager needs broad permissions, so here is the whole list:
every grant, which binary asks, what it is used for, and what you lose
by refusing it. Everything is refusable; the parts that depend on a
grant hide themselves rather than half-work.

| Grant | Who asks | What it does | Without it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | AeroSpace *or* OmniWM, `omacosy-gesture`, `omacosy-bar` (reads the focused app's menus for the app-pill popup), `omacosy-ffm` (AeroSpace mode only) | Move, resize and focus other apps' windows. This is the tiling itself, and it is the broadest permission here. | Nothing tiles. Not optional in practice. |
| **Input Monitoring** | Karabiner-Elements, `omacosy-gesture` (and OmniWM, under that option) | Karabiner reads keys to remap Caps Lock; `omacosy-gesture` reads raw trackpad contacts, because macOS 26 stopped carrying touch data in normal events. | No Super key, no swipe gestures. |
| **Screen Recording** | `omacosy-overview` | Captures a thumbnail per window for the overview cards, including windows the window manager has stashed offscreen. A screenshot of the visible screen could not see those. | Cards fall back to app icons and titles. |
| **Bluetooth** | `omacosy-bar` | Reads adapter power and the paired-device list for the bluetooth pill and its menu. | The pill hides itself. |
| **Location** | `omacosy-bar` | Reads **only** the wi-fi network's name, which macOS classes as location data. No coordinate is ever requested; the authorisation itself is what unlocks `CWInterface.ssid()`. | The wi-fi popup's title row reads "wi-fi" instead of your network's name. Everything else is unaffected. |
| **Automation** | `omacosy-bar`, `theme-set` | Apple Events to **Spotify** (what is playing; play/pause/next from the media pill) and to **System Events** (sleep, lock and restart from the Apple menu; setting the wallpaper). | The media pill hides; those menu rows do nothing. |
| **Files and Folders** | `omacosy-bar` | Only if your clone lives in `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads`. The bar reads its palette from the theme directory inside the repo, and macOS walls launchd agents off from those folders. | The bar **hangs at startup** waiting on the prompt. Clone to `~/.local/share/omacosy` and this never comes up. |

More on **Location**, because it sounds worse than it is: it buys
exactly one string. The bar requests authorisation and then reads
`ssid()`. It never asks for a position, holds no coordinate and starts
no location updates. Two things are required and neither alone is
enough: measured on macOS 26.3, an unbundled binary reads `nil` however
it is authorised, which is why the bar ships inside a minimal `.app`.
Refuse the grant and you lose the name, nothing else.

### What it does not do

- **No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting.** Nothing is sent
  anywhere about you or this machine.
- **One network call**, ever: `https://wttr.in/?format=j1` on a long
  timer, for the weather pill. wttr.in infers your city from the IP the
  request arrives on; no coordinates are gathered or sent, and the bar
  holds no location API. Delete the weather pill and nothing leaves the
  machine.
- **omacosy's own binaries never run as root.** `install.sh` uses no
  sudo, installs no LaunchDaemon, and every helper it builds runs as
  you, in your login session.
- **Karabiner-Elements does run as root, and you should know that
  before installing.** It is a Homebrew dependency here, purely to turn
  Caps Lock into Super. It ships a DriverKit system extension plus
  daemons that run as root (`Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon`,
  `Karabiner-Core-Service`); that is what the driver-extension approval
  during install is. It is the most privileged thing this repo puts on
  your Mac, and it is third-party. Skip it if that trade is wrong for
  you; you lose the Super key and keep everything else.
- **Nothing here reads your keystrokes.** No omacosy binary opens a
  keyboard event tap. Only Karabiner sees keys, which is inherent to
  remapping one. `omacosy-gesture`'s event tap is gesture-only and
  listen-only (`1 << NSEventTypeGesture`, `kCGEventTapOptionListenOnly`),
  so it cannot see or alter a keystroke. Debug logs
  (`/tmp/omacosy-*.log`) carry window titles, app names and workspace
  numbers, never input.

Grants are tied to a binary's code signature. With an Apple Development
identity present, `install.sh` signs every helper with a stable
identifier so rebuilds keep their grants; without one, macOS treats
each rebuild as a new app and you re-grant after every install.

## App choices

Keybindings launch apps defined in `config/apps.conf`. Defaults are
Ghostty, Safari, Spotify, Slack (terminal, browser, music, messenger).
Override any of them in `config/apps.local.conf` (gitignored), then
re-run `install.sh`:

```sh
# config/apps.local.conf — your picks win over apps.conf
TERMINAL=Korren
BROWSER=Arc
```

Your personal shell config belongs in `~/.zshrc.local`; the repo's
`zshrc` wires the CLI stack and sources it.

## What's inside

| Piece | Tool | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Tiling WM | [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) *or* [OmniWM](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM) via `omacosy-wm-switch` | `config/aerospace/aerospace.template.toml`, `config/omniwm/settings.toml` |
| Super key | [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) (Caps Lock → cmd+ctrl+alt) | `config/karabiner/` (copied, not symlinked — TCC) |
| Status bar, popups, shade | `omacosy-bar` (self-compiled launchd agent, one process draws all of it) | `helper/bar.swift` |
| Window borders + fullscreen shroud | `omacosy-borders` (self-compiled launchd agent) | `helper/borders.swift`, `config/borders.conf` |
| Focus follows mouse | `omacosy-ffm` (self-compiled launchd agent; parked under OmniWM, whose native ffm takes over) | `helper/ffm.swift`, `config/ffm-ignore` |
| Trackpad gestures | `omacosy-gesture` (self-compiled launchd agent; engine absorbed from [aerospace-swipe](https://github.com/acsandmann/aerospace-swipe), MIT) | `helper/gesture/`, `config/gesture/` (live copy: `~/.config/omacosy/gesture.json`) |
| Workspace overview | `omacosy-overview` (self-compiled resident daemon) | `helper/overview.swift` |
| Dwindle split direction | AeroSpace: `on-focus-changed` hook running `omacosy-helper split-hint`; OmniWM: native dwindle + a preselect in `omacosy-spawn` (omarchy's right/below insertion) | `config/aerospace/aerospace.template.toml`, `helper/main.swift` |
| Workspace / window navigation | `omacosy-ws`, `omacosy-cycle`, `omacosy-float`, `omacosy-wm-switch`; under OmniWM all of it rides `omacosy-omni`, a held-socket IPC client | `bin/`, `helper/gesture/omniwm.c` |
| Terminal look & spawn size | Ghostty (hidden titlebar; new windows spawn small so tiling never flashes full-screen) | `config/ghostty/config` |
| Park/restore the stack | `omacosy-toggle` | `bin/omacosy-toggle` |
| System glue | `omacosy-helper` (self-compiled) | `helper/main.swift` |
| Prompt | starship | `config/starship.toml` |
| Shell | zsh | `zsh/zshrc` + your `~/.zshrc.local` |
| CLI stack | fzf, eza, zoxide, ripgrep, bat, lazygit, btop | wired in `zsh/zshrc` |

Why so much of it is self-built:

- **AutoRaise** broke on macOS 26 (cooperative activation), so
  `omacosy-ffm` focuses windows through the same SkyLight calls
  AeroSpace uses.
- **aerospace-swipe** broke because CGEvent taps stopped carrying
  multi-touch data on macOS 26.3. We fixed it (raw MultitouchSupport
  frames) and offered the fixes upstream as
  [#29](https://github.com/acsandmann/aerospace-swipe/pull/29) and
  [#30](https://github.com/acsandmann/aerospace-swipe/pull/30); once
  the daemon had to serve both window managers and carried more of
  our patches than upstream commits, the engine moved in-tree as
  `omacosy-gesture` (MIT notice kept).
- **JankyBorders** keeps a bitmap per window and costs hundreds of MB.
  `omacosy-borders` strokes one CAShapeLayer that the WindowServer
  rasterizes, driven by SkyLight notifications for focus, move and
  resize, so the ring glides with drags without polling.
- **Mission Control** cannot see AeroSpace's virtual workspaces, so a
  workspace overview cannot be had any other way than
  `omacosy-overview` capturing them itself.
- **`omacosy-helper`** covers wallpaper setting (System Events
  scripting half-broke in macOS 14+), CoreAudio output switching,
  IOBluetooth control, cursor position, per-display notch detection,
  and the dwindle split hint.
- **`omacosy-bar`** holds the window model in memory and subscribes to
  the system's own publishers: SkyLight for window churn, IOBluetooth
  for connects, SCDynamicStore for the network, IOPS for battery,
  CoreAudio for volume, DisplayServices for brightness, Spotify's own
  broadcast for the track. It polls for nothing macOS announces; its
  only timers are the weather fetch and the clock. A workspace switch
  repaints in 2.5 ms because it asks no one anything; the shell bar it
  replaced took 164 ms to answer the same event.

## The bar

One process draws all of it: bar, popups and sliders are surfaces of
`helper/bar.swift`. Transparent bar, everything a flat radius-4 pill.
A popup stays open while the pointer is anywhere in the bar or the
popup, and closes when it is in neither. The bar hides itself when a
window takes the whole display, and comes back if you put the pointer
on the very top edge, so brightness and volume stay reachable mid-film
without leaving fullscreen. The climb happens only when a fullscreen
window actually covers the bar — otherwise the top edge belongs to the
auto-hidden native menu bar, which reveals ABOVE the bar and stays
clickable (app menus were unreachable before that fix). It drops back
behind everything when the pointer leaves. Under OmniWM the bar simply
stays visible in its reserved strip and never plays this game.

If the native menu bar ever gets stuck revealed over the bar (a
Tahoe bug, most often poked by a Focus mode's menu-bar icon),
`killall SystemUIServer` resets it.

### Choosing pills

`~/.config/omacosy/bar-pills.conf` sets what each right-cluster pill does,
one `<name> = <mode>` per line. The names are `weather`, `wifi`,
`bluetooth`, `brightness`, `volume`, `battery`, `clock` and `activity`.
The modes are `hide` and `icon`. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```
weather = hide
battery = icon
```

`hide` also skips the pill's provider, so hiding `weather` stops the
wttr.in fetches and hiding `bluetooth` never touches the Bluetooth grant.
`icon` drops the label and keeps the glyph; it is ignored on a pill with no
icon, because the weather pill keeps its glyph in the label.

The file is read once at startup, so restart the bar to apply an edit:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.omacosy.bar"
```

### Adding pills

`~/.config/omacosy/bar-plugins.conf` adds pills without a rebuild. Each
`[name]` section takes a `command`, run by `/bin/sh -c`, whose first line
of stdout becomes the label. `interval` is the gap between runs in seconds
(minimum 1, default 30) and `icon` is an optional glyph.

```
[cpu]
command = ps -A -o %cpu | awk '{s+=$1} END {printf "%.0f%%", s/8}'
interval = 5
```

Plugin pills sit at the left of the right cluster, in file order. Clicking
one runs its command again straight away. A name that matches a built-in
pill is ignored, and so is a section with no `command`. Labels are cut at
32 characters, because the cluster is laid out from the right edge inwards
and a long one would push the other pills off screen.

The command is passed to `sh` as an argument, never spliced into a shell
string. It runs with `~/.local/bin` and the Homebrew prefixes ahead of
`PATH`, so a plugin can name a script or a `brew` binary directly. Like the
rest of this file it is read once at startup.


A command that prints a JSON object instead of a line can also set the
pill's colour and give it a popup:

```json
{
  "label": "10% - 2h 6m",
  "color": "green",
  "rows": [
    {"text": "Claude usage", "hero": true},
    {"separator": true},
    {"text": "Session", "detail": "10%"},
    {"text": "5-hour window", "slider": 0.1},
    {"text": "Resets in 2h 6m", "dim": true}
  ]
}
```

`color` is one of `accent`, `label`, `muted`, `red`, `green` or `yellow`,
resolved from the current theme, and tints both the icon and the label. A
row takes the same `color` names, and a row with an `https` `url` opens it
when clicked. A
colour emoji draws its own colours and ignores the icon tint, which is why
the label carries it too. `icon` overrides the config. A `slider` between 0
and 1 draws a progress track, and on a slider row `text` is a short
right-aligned readout rather than a label, so put the label on the row
above. Give a pill rows and clicking it opens the popup instead of
re-running the command.

A pill draws nothing while its label and its icon are both empty, which is
how a pill reports a state worth no space at all. Send `"icon": ""` to hide
one, because an absent `icon` falls back to the glyph the config names.

`omacosy-claude-usage` ships as an example. It colours the pill by how far
into the five-hour window you are, and opens a popup with that window, the
weekly one, each per-model weekly window, and any extra usage credits.

The first row reports Claude's service status from status.claude.com and
opens the status page when clicked.

It reads Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint with the Claude CLI's own token,
caching the answer for five minutes, because only that endpoint carries the
per-model and credit figures. It never refreshes the token and never writes
to the credential store: a third party rewriting the CLI's own credentials
can race Claude Code and log you out.

When the token is expired or the network is gone it falls back to the
statusline payload saved by `omacosy-claude-statusline`, which needs
neither. That payload has only the five-hour and weekly windows, and after
a window rolls over with no session running it reports `--` rather than a
percentage for a window that no longer exists.

### Microphone and Keep Awake pills

`omacosy-keep-awake` is another example pill. It shows a cup while
something is deliberately keeping the Mac awake, and hides otherwise. It
names no particular app: it reads the power assertions, and ignores the
ones held from the system's own directories, because powerd, coreaudiod
and sharingd hold one as a matter of course. It also ignores an assertion
held by a coding agent, which is a short lease on the machine rather than
a setting you left on. Reading the assertion rather than an app's saved
setting means it still reports the truth after the app holding it quits.
Clicking it lists what is holding the Mac awake and how long each has held
it.

The microphone pill is not a plugin. It is built in, because CoreAudio
costs about 65 ms to open in a fresh process and the bar already holds it
open for the volume pill. It shows a struck-through microphone while the
default input device is muted and nothing at all otherwise, and it follows
a property listener, so it changes the moment the microphone does rather
than at the next poll.

### Workspace icons

You can set workspace icons in the optional
`~/.config/omacosy/workspace-icons.conf` file. Each non-comment line has one
workspace name, an equals sign, and either one Unicode scalar or a reverse-DNS
application bundle identifier.

```
1 = ★
14 = ◆

4 = com.apple.Safari
```

The bar first uses a configured icon. It then uses the icon of the sole app on
that workspace, and finally shows the workspace's last digit. Exact workspace
names win. In this example, workspace `14` uses `◆`, not the `4` shorthand.
The shorthand applies only to multi-digit, all-numeric workspace names ending
in `1` through `9` when they have no valid exact declaration.

The bar reads the file once at startup. To apply an edit, restart it with:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.omacosy.bar"
```

Malformed lines are logged and ignored. A well-formed bundle identifier that
does not resolve to an installed app is unavailable. It blocks shorthand for
that exact workspace, then the bar falls back to the sole app or the digit.
Image paths are unsupported because the bar resolves configured app icons at
startup and does no config-file or image-file I/O while it draws.

- **Apple menu**: the REAL one, read over Accessibility — About This
  Mac, System Settings, Recent Items (drills in, with app and
  file-type icons resolved locally since AX exposes none), Force Quit,
  the power verbs — plus omacosy's Next Theme at the bottom. Hidden
  hold-Option duplicates are collapsed; falls back to a hand-rolled
  list without the Accessibility grant.
- **App menus**: clicking the front-app pill drops that app's actual
  menu bar into a popup — File/Edit/… drill into their real items,
  nested submenus included, and clicking a leaf performs it directly
  via AXPress with no native menu ever appearing. Shortcuts sit
  right-aligned; enabled-state is not rendered because apps validate
  menu items only when a menu opens, so closed-menu reads lie. Menus
  taller than the screen scroll. The one thing the auto-hidden native
  bar still owned, gone.
- **Workspaces**: one segmented capsule per monitor showing only that
  monitor's workspaces; accent pill on the focused one; click to jump.
- **Media**: prev / play-pause / next + track title (Spotify). Centered
  on flat displays, left cluster on notched ones (per-display notch
  detection via `NSScreen.safeAreaInsets`), hidden when Spotify isn't
  running.
- **Bluetooth**: device menu (click to connect/disconnect), power
  toggle.
- **WiFi**: the pill is the icon alone; the popup names the network and
  adds ip and router, signal with a verdict, link rate and security
  generation, channel with its band and width. The name is in the popup
  because an SSID can be arbitrarily wide, and on a notched display a
  long one pushed the right cluster under the notch. The name needs the
  Location grant (see [Permissions](#permissions)).
- **Weather**: wttr.in, cached details popup.
- **Volume**: scroll adjusts, click opens slider + output-device menu,
  right-click mutes.
- **Brightness**: scroll adjusts, click opens a slider (DisplayServices,
  no deps). Scrolling past 0 keeps going: a **shade** dims the display
  below its hardware minimum by scaling gamma, so there is no overlay
  window in the z-order and screenshots come out normal. It survives
  sleep/wake and it reaches external displays, which have no backlight
  API. Gamma is reset when the setting process exits, so a crash or an
  uninstall restores the screen by itself.
- **Battery**: charge and state, live draw in watts, the adapter's
  wattage, time to full or empty when the rate is settled, and health as
  the ratio of full charge to design capacity, which keeps moving after
  Apple's own figure has rounded to 100%. A leaf or a speedometer joins
  the cell in low or high power mode, and a thermal row appears once the
  system reports anything above nominal. Low power mode publishes a
  change, so it is immediate. High power mode publishes nothing, not even
  when you leave it, so it is re-read on the minute tick and again
  whenever the popup opens.
- **Clock** (calendar popup) / **Activity** (floating btop).
- **Floats**: appears only while the workspace holds floating windows;
  click surfaces the next one.

## Keybindings — Super = hold Caps Lock

Karabiner remaps Caps Lock to `cmd+ctrl+alt` (a combo macOS never
uses), so omarchy's scheme works letter-for-letter without breaking
typing or app shortcuts. Caps Lock tapped alone is Escape.

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| **Navigation** | |
| `Super+1..9` | switch to this display's workspace N |
| `Super+tab` / `Super+shift+tab` | next / previous workspace, within this display's set |
| `Super+b` | back and forth between the last two workspaces |
| `Alt+tab` / `Alt+shift+tab` | cycle windows **on this workspace**, floats included |
| `Ctrl+Alt+tab` / `Ctrl+Alt+shift+tab` | cycle focus between displays. Under OmniWM the cursor moves with focus, so `Super+1..9` then acts on that display. A display with no workspace is skipped |
| `Super+arrows` | focus the window in that direction |
| `Super+s` | surface the next floating window (and bring the cursor) |
| **Moving windows** | |
| `Super+shift+arrows` | AeroSpace: move the window in that direction. OmniWM: **swap** tiles (`ctrl+opt+shift+arrows` stacks into the neighbor as a group instead) |
| `Super+shift+1..9` | move the window to workspace N and follow it |
| `Super+shift+o` | throw the window to the same slot on the other display |
| `Super+shift+space` | throw the WHOLE workspace to the other display |
| **Layout** | |
| `Super+w` | close window |
| `Super+t` | toggle floating |
| `Super+j` | toggle split direction |
| `Super+-` / `Super+=` | narrower / wider. OmniWM: the column under niri, the split under dwindle |
| `Super+shift+-` / `Super+shift+=` | OmniWM: shorter / taller, in either layout |
| `Super+f` | fullscreen — on notched displays the camera strip is blacked out so it reads as true fullscreen, while the window stays in its workspace (swipes still reach it) |
| `Super+n` | native macOS fullscreen (a separate Space — outside the workspace model, avoid unless an app needs it) |
| `Super+r` | resize mode (`h/j/k/l`, `-`/`=`, `esc`) — AeroSpace only; OmniWM has no binding modes |
| `Super+shift+;` | service mode (`esc` reload, `r` flatten, `⌫` close others) |
| **Apps and system** | |
| `Super+enter` / `Super+shift+enter` | terminal / browser |
| `Super+space` | launcher (Raycast; the OmniWM option opens OmniWM's command palette instead) |
| `Super+shift+f` / `+m` / `+g` | files / music / messenger (set in `apps.conf`) |
| `Super+shift+e` / `+c` / `+y` | Outlook / Teams / a YouTube web app |
| `Super+shift+t` | next theme |
| `Super+shift+b` | next wallpaper of the current theme |
| `Super+shift+l` | lock the screen |
| `Super+k` | keybinding cheatsheet (this table, rendered from the config) |

![The keybinding cheatsheet — every binding, parsed from aerospace.toml](docs/screenshots/cheatsheet.jpg)

Screenshots, clipboard and app switching stay macOS's own
(`Cmd+Shift+3/4/5`, `Cmd+C/V`, `Cmd+Tab`). `Alt+Tab` above is the
*window*-scoped switcher macOS lacks.

**On the modifier space.** omarchy layers `Super+Ctrl` and `Super+Alt`
on top of `Super`. This setup cannot: Super IS `cmd+ctrl+alt`, so those
modifiers are already spent and Shift is the only layer left, two
against omarchy's four. Bindings that would collide are re-homed by
mnemonic (lock is `Super+Shift+L`, not `Super+Ctrl+L`), and the
overflow lives in binding modes instead.

Each display owns an independent set of nine workspaces, omarchy style:
main holds 1–9, secondary holds 11–19, and under OmniWM a third display
holds 21–29. Same last digit means the same
slot, and the bar and overview render only the slot digit. `Super+N`
switches the focused monitor's slot N (via `omacosy-ws`);
`Super+Shift+N` moves the window to that slot; `Super+Shift+O` throws
the window to the same slot on the other monitor. Windows open on the
workspace you're on; nothing is auto-assigned by app.

**Unplugging folds the second display's workspaces into the first.**
AeroSpace parks 11–19 on the remaining display, but `Super+N` and
`Super+Tab` only match single-digit slots, so without help every window
on a secondary workspace would be stranded where no keybinding reaches
it. On a monitor-count change the bar runs `omacosy-ws-collapse`: each
occupied guest workspace empties into the lowest free 1–9 slot,
occupied slots are never touched, and every moved window is recorded
with its origin. Plug the display back in and they go home
individually, so anything you opened while undocked stays put.

## Themes

`theme-set <name>` switches everything at once: bar, borders, wallpaper
on every display, and any terminal that follows omarchy's
`~/.config/omarchy/current/theme` convention (the author's does).
`Super+Shift+T` cycles.

Each theme ships omarchy's full wallpaper set. `Super+Shift+B` (or
`theme-bg-next`) cycles through them; `theme-bg-next <path>` sets any
image you like. Switching themes restarts at the theme's first
wallpaper.

Themes: `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `catppuccin-latte`, `gruvbox`,
`osaka-jade`. Each
`themes/<name>/` holds `colors.toml` (omarchy's 22-color palette),
`sketchybar.sh` / `borders.sh` (bar and ring colors; the file keeps its
omarchy name and format, and the ring uses the theme accent, omarchy's
own convention), and `backgrounds/` (wallpapers from omarchy's
MIT-licensed theme packs). Copy a directory to add one.

Every colour in `sketchybar.sh` is `0xAARRGGBB`, so the leading byte sets
opacity. `ITEM_BG` fills the pills on the bar and `ROW_BG` fills a
highlighted row or a slider track inside a popup. They are separate
because a pill that reads well at half opacity over a wallpaper is too
faint for a track inside a solid popup. A theme that names only `ITEM_BG`
gets it for both, which is what they were before the split.

Under OmniWM, `theme-set` also writes `[appearance] mode` in
`settings.toml`. It reads the luminance of the theme's `background`
colour, so a light theme gets light chrome without extra configuration.

`theme-set` also writes `~/.config/omacosy/ghostty-theme` from the palette
and asks Ghostty to reload. The Ghostty config includes that file, so the
terminal follows the desktop theme. Do not set `theme` in
`~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config.ghostty`: macOS
config files load after the XDG one, so it would win.

The reload goes through `omacosy-helper ghostty-reload`, not `SIGUSR2`.
Ghostty reloads on that signal only on Linux; on macOS it accepts the
signal and ignores it, which looks like success from the sending side. The
helper aims one Apple Event at each Ghostty process, because omacosy opens
an instance per window while AppleScript addresses an app by bundle and so
would reach only one of them.

herdr follows too. `theme-set` writes `[theme] name` in
`~/.config/herdr/config.toml` and runs `herdr server reload-config`. It
does not keep a copy of herdr's theme list: it writes this theme's name,
and an unknown one comes back as a reload diagnostic, which falls back to
herdr's `terminal` theme. Prefer a real match where one exists. `terminal`
takes the host palette, but reads its text colour from the ANSI white
slot, so on a light theme the sidebar turns pale grey.

### Light and dark

`theme-set` also takes a light/dark pair, in the same syntax as Ghostty's
`theme` key:

```
theme-set light:catppuccin-latte,dark:catppuccin
```

With a pair, the theme follows the macOS appearance. The bar runs
`theme-set` with the pair again when the appearance changes, and once when
it starts. `theme-set` with one name, or `Super+Shift+T`, pins that theme
until you set a pair again. `~/.config/omacosy/theme.conf` holds the
current setting. Under OmniWM, a pair sets `[appearance] mode` to
`automatic`.

On the first switch, macOS asks whether omacosy-bar can control Ghostty.
If you do not allow it, the terminal keeps its old colours.

## Tiling: dwindle

![Three terminals in a dwindle layout — README, git log and btop — accent border ring on the focused one](docs/screenshots/tiling.jpg)

AeroSpace natively inserts new windows as equal siblings, so three
windows become three columns. Hyprland's dwindle splits the focused
window along its own longer edge instead: a new window lands beside a
wide window and below a tall one. That is the omarchy feel, and on a
3440-wide display it is also the difference between a usable third
window and three narrow strips.

AeroSpace cannot express that rule. Its config language has no window
geometry; the format variables are ids, titles and container layouts,
with no width or height anywhere. So the direction is decided in code:
the `on-focus-changed` hook runs `omacosy-helper split-hint`, which
reads the newly focused window's frame and issues
`aerospace split horizontal` or `vertical` on it.

The timing is what matters. The hint lands before the next window
exists, so AeroSpace places that window correctly in its first pass.
An earlier version was a daemon that re-nested windows after AeroSpace
had already placed them, and you could see it: the screen laid out
twice, about 250ms apart. What remains now is the new window's own
first frame, which appears about 150ms before AeroSpace tiles it. No
window manager can place a window that does not exist yet.

Two implementation notes. `enable-normalization-flatten-containers` is
off, because it dissolves the very container `split` creates (AeroSpace
prints a warning saying so if you try). And the hint waits for the
window's frame to hold still before reading it, then names its window
with `--window-id` instead of trusting "the focused window". Both guard
against the same thing: a new window fires the hook too (it takes focus
on open), at a moment when its frame is still the app's default shape
and another window may grab focus before the hint lands. One hook
covers both hover and keyboard focus: AeroSpace notices the focus
`omacosy-ffm` moves, even though ffm moves it through SkyLight.

Manual control (Super+J flips, resize, float) works unchanged.

Floats get a rescue path, because macOS will not keep them on top:
z-order is per app, not per window, so a float sinks behind whichever
app you focus next, and pinning it would need a private call with SIP
off. Instead the bar grows a pill whenever the focused workspace holds
floats, and **Super+S** or a click on that pill surfaces the next one
and brings the cursor with it.

## Two window managers (OmniWM option, beta)

AeroSpace is the default. [OmniWM](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM)
is a newer, signed-and-notarized tiling WM with a native dwindle
layout — omacosy can run on either, and switching is one command:

```sh
omacosy-wm-switch omniwm      # installs OmniWM on first use, then
                              # switches with a guarded handover
omacosy-wm-switch aerospace   # the way back
```

The switch is deliberately paranoid: it snapshots your windows, waits
for you to grant OmniWM's permissions, and requires you to confirm
within 90 seconds that workspace switching works — anything else
reverts to AeroSpace automatically and puts your windows back.

Under OmniWM everything keeps working — bar, overview (with
type-to-search), gestures, keybindings, themes — and the dwindle
layout is native, so the split-hint machinery below simply isn't
needed there. What changes: OmniWM draws the focus border (themed by
theme-set), app-launching chords run through Karabiner rules that the
switch installs and removes, and Super+Space opens OmniWM's command
palette instead of Raycast.

Under OmniWM the plumbing changes shape: `Super+N`/`Hyper+N` route
through Karabiner into `omacosy-omni` (a held-socket IPC client) so
slots resolve on the display under your cursor — OmniWM's native
hotkeys are name-global and would always hit the main set — at the
cost of ~40 ms per chord. `Hyper+arrows` swap tiles; OmniWM's own
directional move *stacks* windows into a group, which stays available
on `ctrl+opt+shift+arrows`.

Workspaces use OmniWM's niri layout, which scrolls a row of columns.
`Option+Shift+L` toggles one workspace to dwindle. The resize chords
work in both layouts: each one tries the niri command first, and that
command fails on a dwindle workspace, so the dwindle one runs instead.
Keyboard focus also moves the cursor (`moveMouseToFocusedWindow`),
because `Super+N` resolves on the display under the cursor.

OmniWM has no "third display" assignment, so 21–29 are pinned to one
display by its UUID (`type = "specificDisplay"` in `settings.toml`).
Change `displayUUID` to use another display. Without that display,
OmniWM moves 21–29 to the nearest one, where they share its bar.

Honesty section: this option is daily-driven on the author's desk
(0.6.4, docked multi-monitor, each display running its own nine
workspaces), and docs/omniwm-port.md carries a ledger of upstream
quirks found while porting — read it before assuming a weird layout is
omacosy's fault. AeroSpace remains the longer-tested default.

## Focus follows mouse & swipes

Under the OmniWM option this daemon is parked: OmniWM's native
focus-follows-mouse (with warp-to-focus and hover-raise) replaces it.
Under AeroSpace, `omacosy-ffm`: hover focuses, with no raise over floating windows, so
floats stay in front. It is event-driven off mouse movement, so a
parked cursor never steals focus from a launching window. It never
changes focus during drags, and never through an always-on-top panel:
hovering a Touch ID prompt leaves focus exactly where it is instead of
falling through to the window beneath. Per-app opt-out lives in
`config/ffm-ignore` (omarchy's JetBrains-style exception).

4-finger swipes left/right switch workspaces on the display under the
cursor (native-Spaces semantics), with wrap-around, on any trackpad.
The system's own 4-finger gestures are disabled by `macos-defaults.sh`
so Mission Control never fights the daemon; `uninstall.sh` restores
them.

Under OmniWM, OmniWM's own 3-finger swipe switches workspaces, and the
daemon keeps only the 4-finger swipe up for the overview.
`macos-defaults.sh` turns off the system's 3-finger swipe between
full-screen apps so the two do not fight.

## Workspace overview

![Workspace overview — live preview cards over the zoomed-out wallpaper, chips for empty workspaces](docs/screenshots/overview.jpg)

4-finger **swipe up**: the wallpaper breathes in behind a dim wash and
every non-empty workspace of the cursor's monitor gets a card
(per-display Mission Control semantics), with live window previews
(ScreenCaptureKit, composed into the tile layout), app icons, and an
accent ring on the focused workspace. Click a card or press its digit
to jump; empty workspaces show as small chips, and digits work for them
too. **Swipe down**, Esc, or a backdrop click dismisses. It is a
resident daemon, so it opens instantly.

**Type to search** while it is open: a search pill filters cards to
matching window titles and apps as you type, `Enter` jumps to the
first hit, `Esc` clears the filter before it closes the overview.
Digits type into an active filter instead of switching, so numeric
titles stay reachable.

**Drag a card** to reorganize: the row makes room as you move, and the
drop slides everything between the old and new position over by one.
Workspaces cannot be renamed or resequenced in either WM (the name is
the position), so what actually moves is their windows, which means a
split layout inside a moved workspace comes back as a flat row. Dropping a
card on an empty chip moves that workspace there instead.

## Parking the setup

`omacosy-toggle off` returns to a vanilla Mac in one command (AeroSpace
stops managing, all daemons and the bar stop) without uninstalling;
`omacosy-toggle on` brings everything back. No argument flips.

## Memory use

About **157MB** of physical footprint (what Activity Monitor calls
Memory) across WM, bar, three background daemons, the gesture daemon and
Karabiner, measured docked to a second display. Resident set size reads
~322MB, but RSS counts each process's share of the same shared system
frameworks more than once, so footprint is the number to compare.
(Measured in AeroSpace mode; OmniWM mode is a wash — its ~44MB WM
replaces AeroSpace plus the parked `omacosy-ffm`.)
Largest first:

| | footprint | RSS |
|---|---|---|
| `omacosy-overview` | 36MB | 46MB |
| `omacosy-bar` | 32MB | 55MB |
| AeroSpace | 24MB | 85MB |
| Karabiner (4 processes) | 24MB | 61MB |
| `omacosy-borders` | 19MB | 29MB |
| `omacosy-gesture` | 13MB | 22MB |
| `omacosy-ffm` | 10MB | 24MB |

On one display the same set measured ~155MB; the bar and the border
overlay each draw per-screen, and AeroSpace carries a second workspace
set. The figures move with uptime. `omacosy-overview` caches a
half-resolution capture per window shown, so it starts near 9MB and
settles around 37MB; it plateaus there rather than climbing, because
the cache is refiltered to the visible set on each open. AeroSpace
drifts the other way, reading higher the longer it runs. Packaging the
bar as an `.app` (which is what unlocks the wi-fi network name) cost
about 1MB; the bundle is a directory and an Info.plist, not a second
copy of anything.

## Back to a normal Mac

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Manifest-driven: `install.sh` records what this machine actually gained
(Homebrew packages that weren't already present, cloned repos, every
`defaults` key's prior value), and `uninstall.sh` removes and restores
exactly that. Tools and settings you had before omacosy are never
touched. Pre-manifest installs fall back to a conservative teardown
that leaves all Homebrew packages in place.
